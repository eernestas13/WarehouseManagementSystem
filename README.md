# WarehouseManagementSystem
A program to create/control items in a Warehouse

The objective of this CA was to create a warehouse management system in Java that makes
heavy use of custom-built internal data structures. 
The system allows the user to manage a warehouse that is made up of multiple floors. 
Every floor is made up of multiple aisles. 
Every aisle is made up of multiple shelves. 
Every shelf can store multiple pallets. 
A pallet contains a quantity of a single good. 
So, goods must be stored on a pallet, a pallet stored on a shelf, a shelf must be in an
aisle, and an aisle on a given floor.

We were not to use any existing Java collections or data structures
classes e.g. ArrayList, LinkedList, or any other class that implements the Collection interface
or any of its children.
